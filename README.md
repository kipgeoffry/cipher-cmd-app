## Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption (Java)

**Author:** kip geoffry

## Description

A Caesar cipher is a type of substitution in which each letter is shifted a certain number of places, also known as a key, down the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, 'A' would be replaced by 'B', 'B' would become 'C', and so on.

This Java project implements a Caesar cipher, both for encoding and decoding text. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. The cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (from 'A' to 'Z'). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet, wrapping 'Z' to 'A'. For example, key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC".

## Project Setup Instructions

To set up and run the Caesar Cipher Java program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Open your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3. Import the project into your IDE.

4. Locate the main Java file (`CaesarCipher.java`) and run it.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt, as well as the encryption key.

## Live Site

As this is a Java project, there is no live site on GitHub Pages. You can access and run the project locally following the setup instructions mentioned above.
